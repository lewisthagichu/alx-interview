0x08-making_change

## Overview

In the "0. Change comes from within" project, you'll be addressing a classic problem in the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The goal is to determine the minimum number of coins required to reach a given total amount, given a set of coin denominations. This project will challenge you to apply your knowledge of algorithms to devise a solution that is both correct and efficient.

## Key Concepts

### Greedy Algorithms:

- Understanding the principles of greedy algorithms and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.
- Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they may not provide the optimal solution.

### Dynamic Programming:

- Basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
- Understanding overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, especially in the context of the coin change problem.

### Algorithmic Complexity:

- Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

### Problem-Solving Strategies:

- Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems.
- Comparing iterative and recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

### Python Programming:

- Manipulating lists and utilizing list comprehensions.
- Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
