# 0x09. Island Perimeter

# Concepts Needed:

## 2D Arrays (Matrices):

- Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
- Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

## Conditional Logic:

- Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

## Counting Techniques:

- Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.

## Problem-Solving Strategies:

- Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

## Python Programming:

- Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
- Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
